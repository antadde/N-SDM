\usage{
nsdm.datacheck(data_dir, n_levels)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_dir}{Character. Path to the main data directory (must contain subfolders like 'covariates', 'species', 'masks').}

\item{n_levels}{Integer. Number of spatial levels included (1 for 'reg' only, 2 for both 'reg' and 'glo').}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a data.frame with consistency results for sampled rasters (extent, resolution, CRS, grid).
If inconsistencies are found, the function stops and reports the problematic files or species mismatches.
}
\description{
Validates the data for an NSDM-compliant run.
Specifically, this function checks that:
\itemize{
\item All required subfolders (e.g., masks, species, covariates) are present.
\item Covariate data follows the expected folder hierarchy.
\item Covariate data follows the expected naming convention.
\item For each level ('reg', 'glo'), a subset of raster files is sampled and checked for consistent extent, resolution, CRS, and grid alignment.
\item The CRS and grid of the covariate and mask rasters are compared to a sample of species coordinates to ensure compatibility.
