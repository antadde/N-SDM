\usage{
nsdm.ensembleeval(level, model_names, species_name, nesting_name = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{level}{Character. Either \code{"glo"} or \code{"reg"}, indicating the spatial modeling level.}

\item{model_names}{Character vector. The names of the modeling algorithms to ensemble (e.g., \code{c("glm", "rf", "esm")}).}

\item{species_name}{Character. Name of the species/taxon being evaluated.}

\item{nesting_name}{Character (default = NA). Name of the nesting strategy to evaluate, such as \code{"multiply"}, \code{"multiplyw"}, or \code{"covariate"}.}
}
\value{
A named list of ensemble evaluation scores (mean values across replicates), with one element per ensemble type (e.g., \code{"GLO"}, \code{"REG"}, \code{"MUL"}, \code{"COV"}).
}
\description{
Evaluate ensemble predictions for a given species, level, and nesting strategy.
}
\details{
This function loads the best model(s) for each algorithm, applies them to test data,
generates predictions, and evaluates ensemble performance using a specified criterion.

This function assumes the model predictions and evaluation metrics have been previously computed and stored.
Ensemble strategies include:
\itemize{
\item GLO: global-level ensemble.
\item REG: regional ensemble.
\item MUL: multiply nested ensemble.
\item MULW: multiplyw nested ensemble.
\item COV: covariate nested ensemble.
}

Evaluation is performed using \code{nsdm.ceval()}, and results are returned as averaged scores over replicates.
