)
}
\arguments{
\item{pres}{A \code{data.frame} containing species occurrence data with the following key columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{species}: Taxon name.
\item \code{X} and \code{Y}: Coordinates.
\item \code{year}: Observation year.
}}

\item{rst}{A reference \verb{Raster*} object used in subsequent analyses. Defines the spatial resolution and extent for the disaggregation.}

\item{thindist}{A numeric value specifying the minimum spatial distance (in the units of \code{rst}) between two occurrences for spatial disaggregation.}

\item{thinyear}{A numeric value specifying the minimum temporal separation (in years) between two occurrences at the same raster pixel.}

\item{min_occ}{A numeric value specifying the minimum number of occurrences required for a species to be included in the modeling dataset.}

\item{ncores}{A numeric value specifying the number of cores to use for parallel operations during disaggregation.}
}
\value{
A \code{sf} object containing the updated and disaggregated species occurrence data.
}
\description{
Spatiotemporal Disaggregation of Species Data
}
\details{
This function performs spatiotemporal disaggregation of species occurrence data by ensuring a minimum distance between occurrences in space and time, and filtering species with insufficient occurrences for modeling.

The function ensures that species occurrences meet the specified spatial and temporal separation criteria. It also filters out species that do not meet the minimum occurrence threshold. The function is optimized for parallel processing when \code{ncores} is greater than 1.
