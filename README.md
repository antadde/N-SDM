<h3>ðŸ“¢ Upcoming Release â€“ September/October 2025</h3>

A new version of N-SDM is coming soon with updated features and improved workflows. Details will be announced here.

# About N-SDM

N-SDM is a high-performance computing pipeline for Nested-Species Distribution Modeling, addressing spatial niche truncation by combining global, coarse-grain models with regional, fine-grain models. This approach preserves the full niche while keeping local resolution and precision, improving biodiversity projections under global change. The pipeline integrates automated covariate selection, multiple modeling algorithms, ensemble methods, and scalable parallel processing for efficient reproducible assessments across species and scenarios.

# Prerequisites

1. **Linux HPC cluster** equipped with the **Slurm Workload Manager**.
   
2. A **clone of the N-SDM GitHub repository** in the working directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/antadde/N-SDM.git nsdm
   ```

3. An installation of the **nsdm2 R package**:
   ```r
   # --- Stable release ---
   # NOT OUT YET
   
   # --- Development version ---
   remotes::install_github("antadde/N-SDM/Rpkg")
   ```
   
4. [Optional for running the N-SDM example] Download and unzip the example dataset available at https://zenodo.org/records/17350436 in the `./data` directory. Details about the data are available on Zenodo.
   ```bash
	# go to your nsdm directory

	# download the archive
	wget -c "https://zenodo.org/record/17350436/files/data.zip?download=1" -O data.zip

	# unzip and overwrite existing files if needed
	unzip -o data.zip
   ```

# Example N-SDM run

We will run an applied example to demonstrate the main operations and outputs of N-SDM by modeling the habitat suitability of three species (Larix decidua, Capra ibex, and Cantharellus cibarius) at 100-meter resolution across Switzerland, for the current period and a future period (2085).

## Study area

Following the spatially-nested framework, we distinguished between 'regional' and 'global' study areas. The regional area encompassed all of Switzerland. For the global area, we used a bounding box spanning the European continent.

## Data

Further details on covariate and species data preparation are available in the [DATA_PREPARATION.odt](./documentation/DATA_PREPARATION_20251002.odt) document located in the `documentation` directory.

### Species data

Global-level species occurrence records were obtained from GBIF, and regional-level records from the Swiss Species Information Center. To reduce spatial clustering, records were disaggregated automatically by N-SDM so that no two points were closer than 1 km at the global level and 200 m at the regional level. For each species and level, 10,000 background absence points were randomly generated across the target areas to contrast with the occurrence records. These settings can be edited in the './settings/settings.psv' file.

### Covariate data

We used a suite of 374 candidate covariates categorized into six main categories: bioclimatic, land use and cover, edaphic, topographic, population density, transportation, and vegetation. Only bioclimatic covariates were used to fit the global-level model, while all other categories were used for the regional model. To capture environmental conditions beyond the immediate occurrence points, covariates from the 'land use and cover' category were extracted using 13 moving radii, ranging from 25 m to 5 km.

## N-SDM settings

Further details on N-SDM settings and hyperparameter tuning options are available in the [SETTINGS_DETAILS.odt](./documentation/SETTINGS_DETAILS_20251002.odt) and [ALGORITHMS_PARAMETERS.odt](./documentation/ALGORITHMS_PARAMETERS_20251003.odt) documents located in the `documentation` directory.

N-SDM settings must be adapted to your computing environment (e.g., paths and module versions) by editing the `settings.psv` file in `./scripts/settings` with an editor that preserves the `"|"` delimiter. You can also customize data and modeling options such as covariate selection, modeling algorithms, and ensembling strategies.  

In the same `./scripts/settings` directory:  
- `param_grid.psv` defines the grid for hyperparameter tuning  
- `expert_table.psv` (pre-filled) allows expert-based prefiltering of candidate covariates

Note that N-SDM is now designed so that any Slurm-specific options not covered in settings.psv can be managed directly in the template file `./helpers/job_template.sbatch.in`. This allows to include optional additional directives such as: #SBATCH --account=... #SBATCH --qos==... #SBATCH --constraint=... etc.

## Running N-SDM

Position yourself in the `./scripts` directory, where the main N-SDM bash file (nsdm.sh) is stored.

It is recommended to run N-SDM in the background using no hangup mode, so the process continues even if you log out or close the shell. Use the following command:

```bash
nohup bash nsdm.sh > nsdm.out &
```

You can monitor the execution of N-SDM by checking the main `nsdm.out` file, and inspecting the individual job files (.sbatch, .err, .out) generated in the `./log` directories of each key step (pre, glo, reg, sce).

## Outputs
Further details on N-SDM outputs are available in the [OUTPUTS_DETAILS.odt](./documentation/OUTPUTS_DETAILS_20251003.odt) document located in the `documentation` directory.

Each N-SDM run produces a structured set of outputs stored first in the **scratch directory**, then automatically synchronized to the **save directory**.  
- The **scratch folder** serves as temporary storage and may be cleared before a new run.  
- The **save folder** provides a permanent archive of finalized results.  
- The list of synchronized outputs can be customized via the `rsync_exclude` parameter in `settings/settings.psv`.

Below is a snapshot of key sample output folders generated by N-SDM:
| Folder | Description | Format |
|:--------|:-------------|:------------------|
| `d3_evals` / `d11_evals-ensembles` | Model evaluation metrics for individual algorithms and ensembles | `.psv` |
| `d4_covimps` | Covariate importance scores | `.psv` |
| `d10_nested-ensembles` | Final nested ensemble maps | `.tif` |
| `d16_nested-ensembles-sce` | Final nested ensemble maps for each scenario Ã— period | `.tif` |
| `sacct` | SLURM job summaries (status, memory, CPU usage) | `.psv` |
